Guitar tuner
------------

This is a simple guitar tuner made by somebody from gnome.org who wrote the 
gtk+ tutorial examples.

It is slightly modified by me but it does not work at all right now.
The intention is to learn gtk programming and maybe really one day finish it
by having a functional  guitar tuner, or better a source of all the 12 tones
in a chromatic scale.
